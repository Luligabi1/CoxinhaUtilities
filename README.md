A standalone utility mod adding random and ~~mostly~~ always unoriginal things.. Better with [Kibe Utilities](https://github.com/lucaargolo/kibe).

## Special thanks

Once a Kibe Utilities addon, Coxinha became standalone and with that, the Trash Can model from Kibe had to be imported here. Huge thanks to D4rkness_King for allowing this and being an awesome friend :)
